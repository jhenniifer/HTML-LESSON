The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document and character encoding is a 
system that assigns a unique numerical value (code point) to each character. It allows computers to understand
and represent text in different languages and character sets. Without proper character encoding,
text rendering and interpretation can be incorrect.

In this case, "charset=utf-8" indicates that the page is encoded using the UTF-8 character set. 
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can represent characters from virtually all writing systems
in the world. It is part of the Unicode standard, which aims to encompass all characters used in human writing
systems. UTF-8 uses one to four bytes to represent characters, with ASCII characters represented using a single
byte (backward compatibility). It is the most commonly used character encoding on the web.

Before the UTF-8, other character encoding were used such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange),
CP-1252 and ISO-8859.The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set. 
The UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
